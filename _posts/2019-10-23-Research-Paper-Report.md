<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Emerging trends in location-based services (LBS) and social media along with the ever-increasing popularity of hiking encouraged an application combining these components. So, researchers wanted to discover needs from people interested in hiking and related outdoor activities. Through questionnaires, focus group discussions, and empathy probes (diaries), user requirements were determined and grouped into wider thematic categories: planning a hike, additional information on the area, "I am here" services, location of other hikers, changing conditions, emergency situations, saving experiences, sharing experiences, integrated and adaptive services. They further grouped these themes into before, during, and after the hike activities. Based on these themes and the data from users, the researchers emphasized the necessity for LBS emergency help, up-to-date information, community. LBS should be used to navigate users but also contact emergency services and find the fastest routes for users to leave the hiking trail or wilderness area that they're in. Users need up-to-date information when they are planning hikes as well as on the trail. These needs range from weather conditions, landmark (ex. Northern Lights) conditions to the availability of shelters. The community aspect involves the sharing of trails, locations, pictures and memories with more people than just friends and family. I believe the researcher's points because they are transparent about their interviews and information collecting proceses. However, one thing that might influence the data is the fact that they seemed to have a focus on certain interactions beforehand (like social, emergency). But also, because the paper is rather old (2009), the fact that social-interaction is such a major aspect is not surprising.</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Much like our team, the (UX) researchers in the paper sought to discover the tasks that current people interested in outdoor activities performed. Their research serves as a good measuring stick/comparative model to the work we've done. The difference between us and them is that they initially approached the project with a solution involving navigation + human-social interaction. We started with navigation + wildlife interaction. So, this can lead to skewed results because researchers approach "discovering the problem" with an existing expection of the high level problems. For the most part, the information we found was the same as the researchers. I don't think there is anything in the paper that strikes me as particularly surprising or undermines our results, but, I do think it would be interesting to have focused more on social-interaction. Even though the research paper is a bit old, combining our findings with theirs should lead to a more complete understanding of issues and better design. With better technology now and doing CIs as well, I feel that we have improved on findings from the paper. The paper discussed the trouble of finding a design for the idea, but with the power of mobile-devices now, it seems like that is a feasible solution. We can produce a better design, capable of supporting more user tasks. However, it is still important to take into account the findings from the paper; they have done more research that can build on our existing ideas and things to incorporate.</span>
