<span style="color:#E7DFDD">I remember my first few days at Williams when I felt a bit overwhelmed with moving in, attending classes, and making new friends.</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD"> had to go to my trumpet audition at the back of the second floor of the music building.</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">I'm a bit late, but I ask around and I'm told to go down the hall, which had 3 glass doors.</span>

![Door 1](/hci/img/bd1.jpeg)

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">I see the first door and it's slightly ambiguous as to whether it's a push or a pull.</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">I guess and check. It's a push.</span>

![Door 2](/img/bd2.jpeg)

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">At this point I'm in a bit of a rush, so I attempt to push this door since the last one was a push.</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">This door was a pull.</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">I'm finally at the last door and use the same logic as before.</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">I'm not paying attention to what the door handles look like so I pull on this one.</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Turns out it's actually a push again.</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Even to this day, I sometimes have to think about whether the first door is a push or pull and go through the rest remembering that they change the opening strategy from door to door.</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">I do not think this door system is good design.</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">The handles are a bit ambiguous and since people walk in one direction either up or down the hall carrying instruments, people like myself intiuitively assume that the doors open in the same direction.</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">In the end, this design burdens the user with a decision to make for each of the 3 doors in the hall.</span>
