I remember my first days at Williams last year when I felt a bit overloaded with moving in and all the new things. 

I had to go to my trumpet audition at the back of the second floor of the music building. 

I'm a bit late, but I ask around and I'm told to go down the hall, which had 3 glass doors.

I see the first door and it's a bit ambiguous as to if its a push or a pull.

I guess and check and I figure out its a push.

At this point I'm rushing a bit to get to my audition, so I decide to just push this door because the last one was a push.

However, this door was a pull and I quickly just switch to pull and go through.

I'm finally at the last door and go with the same kind of logic before.

I'm not paying attention to what the door handles look like so I pull on this one. 

Turns out its actually a push again, and I quickly make my way through the last one and get to my audtion. 

Even to this day, sometimes I have to remind myself if the first door is a push or pull and go through the rest remembering that they change the opening strategy. 

I do not think this door system is good design. 

The handles are a bit ambiguous and if you go one direction down the hall, you can't keep pushing/pulling through the whole way. 

In the end, this design burdens the user with a decision to make for each of the 3 doors in the hall.
