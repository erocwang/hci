I remember my first few days at Williams when I felt a bit overwhelmed with moving in, attending classes, and making new friends. 

I had to go to my trumpet audition at the back of the second floor of the music building. 

I'm a bit late, but I ask around and I'm told to go down the hall, which had 3 glass doors.

I see the first door and it's slightyly ambiguous as to whether it's a push or a pull.

I guess and check. It's a push.

At this point I'm in a bit of a rush, so I attempt to push this door since the last one was a push.

This door was a pull.

I'm finally at the last door and use the same logic as before.

I'm not paying attention to what the door handles look like so I pull on this one. 

Turns out it's actually a push again. 

Even to this day, I sometimes have to think about whether the first door is a push or pull and go through the rest remembering that they change the opening strategy from door to door. 

I do not think this door system is good design. 

The handles are a bit ambiguous and since people walk in one direction either up or down the hall carrying instruments, people like myself intiuitively assume that the doors open in the same direction. 

In the end, this design burdens the user with a decision to make for each of the 3 doors in the hall.
