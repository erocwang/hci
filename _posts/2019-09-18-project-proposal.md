**Motivation**  
There are so many fruits and berries that you see while hiking or even just going for walks. A lot of them _look_ edible but how would you know if they are or would even taste good? You could possibly have been a boy scout, maybe a park ranger, or just have studied up on wild berries, but even then you wouldn't know about _all_ of them. 

Learning about the wild berries you find can be a good interactive way to learn about the areas you travel to as well as a fun (daring) way to test your knowledge. 

**Idea**  
A good way to implement this idea would be through a mobile app! Once downloaded, a user can either upload previously taken photos or take photos through the app. The app should analyze the image and return a guess (along with a percentage) as to what the berry/fruit is. This "guessing" can be done through some image/object recognition coupled with AI if possible. It would also be helpful to use GPS tracking so the region can be factored in. Along with the "guess," the app should show similar looking fruits so the user can make the final guess themnselves. I thnk there should also be a community aspect to this app, which also would help gather data to ensure predictions are more accurate. Standard bios for each berry/fruit should be created (either by experts or community verified) so that users can learn more about the fruits they see as well as look up on the app! 

There's an app out right now that identifies mushrooms and is well received in the app store. Berries and fruits will be harder to work with but I think will have much more user retention and usage!
