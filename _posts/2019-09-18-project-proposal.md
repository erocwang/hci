<h1 style="color:#E7DFDD">Motivation</h1>
<span style="color:#E7DFDD">There are so many fruits and berries you find while hiking, and even when you're just going for a short walk. Many of them _look_ edible but how do you know that they are not deadly fruits under a delicious disguise? And even if they were edible, would they even taste good? Perhaps you are a boy scout, a park ranger, or just an avid fruit lover, but even then you wouldn't know about _all_ of them.</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Learning about the wild berries you find is an effective and interactive way to learn about not just the fruits themselves, but also the hidden features about the geography around you. If anything, it's a daring way to test your knowledge.</span> 

<h1 style="color:#E7DFDD">Idea</h1> 
<span style="color:#E7DFDD">A good way to implement this idea would be through a mobile app! Once downloaded, a user can either upload previously taken photos or take photos through the app. The app analyzes the image and returns a guess as to the identity of the berry/fruit,  along with the percent likelihood of the picture matching the guess. This "guessing" would be done through some image/object recognition, possibly coupled with AI. The app would conveniently use GPS tracking to factor in the region. Along with the "guess," the app should show fruits similar in appearance so the user can make the final guess themselves. Experts, locals (such as park rangers and representatives of nature conservatories or museums), and users would help generate standard biographies for each known berry/fruit, and the community (if applicable) can verify it or correct it. The uploading and sharing of photos would build the community aspect of this app, which would help gather data and strengthen the accuracy of the predictions.</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">There's an [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mushroom-identificator/id1227854971) out right now that identifies mushrooms and is well received in the app store. Berries and fruits will be harder to work with but I believe will have better user retention and usage due to their popularity and accessibility.</span>
