Many college libraries use a similar shelf system like this one in Sawyer.

Shelves can be moved forward and backward along a straight track. 

This lets them pack more shelves into smaller spaces. And more shelves of course = more books.

The rotating device looks like it can be spun and its intuitive to assume that by rotating them, a user can move the shelf. 

It's also in good taste that the library has put the "use pin to lock shelves" label above the tool. 

This tells the user that the shelf can be moved and also introduces the user to the lock that might not have been noticed without the label. 

Because there is only the device on the side of the shelf, the user would likely look for the pin on the wheel itself and if they do it is not hard to find it. 

By pulling the lock out, the green portion of the lock is revealed, further good design showing that the user can now move the shelf.
