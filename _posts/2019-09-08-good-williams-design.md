Many college libraries use a similar shelf system like this one in Sawyer.

These shelves can be moved forward and backward along a straight track. 

This lets them pack more shelves into smaller spaces.

The shelf device looks like a "steering-wheel" of sorts and its intuitive to assume that this is the control for moving the shelves. 

It's also in good design that the library has placed labels saying "use pin to lock shelves" above the tool. 

While not pretty, these labels confirms to the user that the shelf can be moved and also introduces the user to the lock that might not have been noticed without the label. 

Although the lock is not labeled, because of the note, the user is inclined to look for the lock (first place to look would be on the wheel, the side of the shelf is bare otherwise) which is on the wheel device. 

By pulling the lock out, the green portion of the lock is revealed.

And like a green light, it signals the user that they can proceed and start moving the shelf. 

This shelf is good design in my opinion. 

It optimizes space and has enough instruction and intuitive controls that a student or librarian can easily understand and use it.
