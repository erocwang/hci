As they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 

Or, probably, the eyes of your stakeholders. 

Anyways, design will always be subjective. And, design components from one project will not necessarily translate to another. But your design philosophy can. 

Based on my experiences in Human-Computer-Interaction, here are what I think are the **8 most important design principles** to consider during your next project. 

# Discovering the Problem 
It is important to establish a solid foundation of knowledge. Without it, your design can run in the wrong direction. 

As such, one of the most important things to set at least somewhat-concretely is the problem you are designing a solution for. 

This is essential to not only defining your research and design methods but also to the success of your project pitches. 

Research methods!

# Understand the User 
Almost all the time, your designs will be used by some kind of person. These are the people that you should center your design around. If they can't use the design, what is the point of anything? 

Research/design methods!

# Get Creative
The design process can be regimented but your choices along the way will make your design, itself, unique. 

It's important to stay creative, because this is where real innovation happens. 

Being creative doesn't mean you have to come up with crazy, new ideas, though. 

Creative ideas oftetn come from building on existing knowledge.

This is where I think you'll have the most fun. Make sure to encourage fruitful brainstorming and ideation.
