<span style="color:#E7DFDD">As they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Or, probably, the eyes of your stakeholders.</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Anyways, design will always be subjective. And, design components from one project will not necessarily translate to another. But your design philosophy can. </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Based on my experiences in Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) class this semester, here are what I think are the **7 most important design principles** to consider during your next project. </span>

<h1 style="color:#E7DFDD">1. Discovering the Problem </h1>
<span style="color:#E7DFDD">It is important to first establish a solid foundation of knowledge. Without it, your design will likely run in the wrong direction. </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">As such, one of the most important things to define the problem for which you are designing a solution for. </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">This is essential to not only defining your research and design methods but also to the success of your project pitches. </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Every design you make will be motivated by some problem. It's your job to evaluate the severity of the issue and determine if the issue is one you can fix.</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">My HCI journey began with [my individual project proposal](https://erocwang.github.io/2019-09-18-project-proposal/). The problem I brought up was the inability for people to identify edible, wild berries. However, this problem is very specific, and doesn't have much room to design solutions for. Because the low reach/impact of the issue and its lack of novelty, it isn't very motivating.  </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">This proposal was done without much research. If I were to have based my whole project on it, there would not be much to work on (not a complex solution) and the solution itself would not be very impactful. In general, a problem that is broad enough that there is enough room to play with a solution but not too narrow that solution creation is limited is ideal. </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">I've learned my lesson from it, and encourage you not to fall to the same mistakes of identifying and presenting a problem like this. </span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Here's a [better proposal](https://hci-sys.github.io/LearningInNature/projectproposal/), from our hikAR group project. This provides a better problem statement to draw the reader in as well as a more overarching problem theme for us to work on and research. </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">It's also important to note that throughout the project, we were constantly changing and refining our problem statement. Here are some examples as we went along: [hikAR research overview](https://hci-sys.github.io/LearningInNature/uxresearchoverview/) [hikAR design overview](https://hci-sys.github.io/LearningInNature/uxdesignoverview/)</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">User research methods are extremely helpful in this process, which leads me to the second principle...</span>

<h1 style="color:#E7DFDD">2. Understanding the User </h1>
<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Almost all the time, your designs will be used by some kind of person. These are the people that you should center your design around. If they can't use the design, _what is the point of designing it in the first place?_</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">There are many existing research methods to get a handle of the people that you would design for. Most of the time, these are the people that are directly affected by your motivating problem. </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Some of these methods include contextual inquiries, interview, and surveys. </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Contextual inquiries and interview are both very hands on, personal ways to retrive user information. Here's a article on [contextual inquirires](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fglow.williams.edu%2Fcourses%2F2539542%2Ffiles%2Ffolder%2Freadings%3Fpreview%3D153992307&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHzYEhhDiXE8sxOVoX7pjGx5esUDA) and one on [interviews](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fglow.williams.edu%2Fcourses%2F2539542%2Ffiles%2Ffolder%2Freadings%3Fpreview%3D153992376&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFON6MK4Pl0BkUaQCgVvQ9VyM4hSQ). I'm not going to tell you which to primarily use; they are both great and it is up to you to decide.  </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Contextual inquiries involve watching a "master" do some sort of task and asking questions as they do it. So, because hikAR is based on serving hikers, contextual inquiries were the better choice for us. Hiking is an activity and one where you sort of need to be there to understand it. [More here](https://hci-sys.github.io/LearningInNature/cireview/)</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">You can always perform more research. No matter how much you do, there is more information out there that will be beneficial to you. Just remember to have done enough for you to comfortably understand the big picture problem and the users.</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Remember, you can't just collect user information and call it a day, though. There are a plethora of research tools to aggregate the information you gather and draw conclusions and identify big picture ideas.</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">One thing you can do is affinity diagramming, [more info here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fglow.williams.edu%2Fcourses%2F2539542%2Ffiles%2Ffolder%2Freadings%3Fpreview%3D153992358&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHP0gRp1undgucu-RX-5f4w8AoTRw)</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Here's a picture of my group's diagram: </span>
![Affinity Diagram](/img/affinity.jpeg)

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">After using some aggregation tools like this, you can create user "profiles" with things like personas and scenarios. My team did not reall dive deep into these methods, but here you can see some [basic persona + scenario crafting here from us](https://hci-sys.github.io/LearningInNature/taskreview/) and read more about [personas here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fglow.williams.edu%2Fcourses%2F2539542%2Ffiles%2Ffolder%2Freadings%3Fpreview%3D153992303&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHl90tx_YiJ9TEBjWx2exyDutvU0A) and [scenarios here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fglow.williams.edu%2Fcourses%2F2539542%2Ffiles%2Ffolder%2Freadings%3Fpreview%3D153992364&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHIutMnZMqAGh5plNkfhe12lGzEJw).</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Storyboards and video sketches are also a great way to demonstrate how a user would use your product/design. Storyboards were 
essential in initally demonstrating [our design](https://hci-sys.github.io/LearningInNature/storyboard/).</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">If you want to read about more research methods, [look here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Febookcentral.proquest.com%2Flib%2Fwillm%2Fdetail.action%3FdocID%3D3399583%23goto_toc&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG5kbrNvjQnZTkGy3cynphK1U3UQA).</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">In fact, they serve as a beginning transition from user research to user design. Now, you should start thinking more about...</span>

<h1 style="color:#E7DFDD">3. Getting Creative</h1>
<span style="color:#E7DFDD">The design process can be regimented but your choices along the way will make your design, itself, unique. </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">It's important to stay creative, because this is where real innovation happens.</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Being creative doesn't mean you have to come up with crazy, new ideas, though. </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Creative ideas often come from building on existing knowledge.</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">This is where I think you'll have the most fun. Make sure to encourage fruitful brainstorming and ideation. </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">I felt that brainstorming in class was a great way for us to come up with design ideas. [Look here](https://hci-sys.github.io/LearningInNature/design_check-in/) to see our designs we came up with after coming together. </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Here's a good article on [how to be creative](https://glow.williams.edu/courses/2539542/files/folder/readings?preview=153992346)</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">And here's an article on [brainstorming tips](https://glow.williams.edu/courses/2539542/files/folder/readings?preview=153992372)</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Being creative doesn't really mean adding extra features you think are cool. Don't waste your precious time and resources: </span>

<h1 style="color:#E7DFDD">4. Making Things Simple</h1>
![Design Graph](/img/graph.png)

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Keeping things simple along the design process will ensure that you create the best solution with the least amount of work. You don't want to get bogged on details that won't even really matter down the line. </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Remember the problem you are designing for. Anything you add or spend time on should be crucial to solving that issue.</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">In fact, problems are often complex, even in our class we have narrowed down from supporting [6 tasks](https://hci-sys.github.io/LearningInNature/taskreview/) to just [2 tasks](https://hci-sys.github.io/LearningInNature/storyboard/). Focus on making a product that does its job in the simplest way first.</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Simple design will also make it easier for your potential users. You don't want someone who tests your design to have difficulty figuring out how to use it. This detracts from them using it to solve their issues.</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Simplicity is necessary for quick development, it's the reason why paper prototypes, affinity diagramming, and other research/design methods use such basic equipment. Keep costs, including time, low and it will also help make it easier...</span>

<h1 style="color:#E7DFDD">5. Letting Your Babies Die</h1> 
<span style="color:#E7DFDD">It's hard to drop something when you become too invested in it. But you also need to remember that designs that you personally like shouldn't be valued over what users like. </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Paper prototypes and rapid usability testing are a good way to allieve personal attachment. This way you spend more time designing for the user rather than yourself.</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Take a look at how our [initial paper prototype](https://hci-sys.github.io/LearningInNature/paper_prototype/) turned out. Even this was a bit too complex so we changed it! The design process should move quickly, in small chunks, keeping things simple and easy to revise.</span>  

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">You will save time and effort, and in the end create a better product. </span>

<h1 style="color:#E7DFDD">6. Designing for Accessibility</h1> 
<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Making designs more accessible can benefit everyone.</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">It benefits you as the designer because it allows you to reach a wider audience of users. Whether you're in it for the money or helping others, this supports both.</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Of course, accessibility is great for those with disabilities. It allows them to use your design better. In fact, making things more acessible also improves functionality for users who don't necessarily need the added features, but might use them from time to time. </span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Because our project is technically still in a rather initial phase of design (not supporting many tasks) we haven't added many accessibility features to our design. We have made and revised our prototype so that it is easier to use, ([look here](https://hci-sys.github.io/LearningInNature/usabilitytestingreview/)), but we could of done much more. This is one thing I would have liked to change possibily, incorporating the principles of accessibility more predominately throughout the research and design process.</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Here is a [good document with acessibility do's and dont's](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fglow.williams.edu%2Ffiles%2F153992322%2Fdownload%3Fdownload_frd%3D1&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGGu6gSbxze0CXtz5BR5Cuf5QV_cw).</span>

<h1 style="color:#E7DFDD">7. Keeping it Ethical</h1> 
<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Ethics are an often unemphasized facet of design. The cut-throat nature and loosely regulated of today's emerging industries have led to this. Companies often times, while trying to get a competetive "edge", will flirt with the law and people's rights.</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Here's an article on [how Uber evaded the law](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F03%2F03%2Ftechnology%2Fuber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHON-TJN3Jo1qrL5lpLRBI0SIWsGw) and another on [how Facebook does little to protect user privacy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qna8UG2zc2pfcJS5caY9o_dLSwGtX0mI/view?usp=sharing).</span> 

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">It's hard to define what's ethical and what's not, but [here's the closest thing to a guide on what defines ethics in industries](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fethics.acm.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNECGQAnVCFWIlPgCbymnie1P8pIMg).</span>

<span style="color:#E7DFDD">It's up to you as designers to uphold ethical integrity before we go on a slippery slope that will lead to even more harm in the future.</span> 

<h1 style="color:#E7DFDD">Final Thoughts</h1> 
<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Overall, the design process should be fun and exciting. These principles should guide you and streamline the process itself. Remember to really understand the issues and people you are designing for, to design simply and effectively (but still with creative power), and to incorporate good ethics and accessibility features along the way.</span> 


<span style="color:#E7DFDD">Designing a User Experience is often very time consuming and intensive. However, with the right methods and outline, the design process will go fast; it always feels like there is something you can do. It is really cool to see how much you've done. Even in just one semester, I think we've accomplished and learned a lot.
